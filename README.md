# mental-distance
Geographic and mental distance between cities mentioned in Russian corpora

My contribution to workshop on research of places in semantic distributional vector models built on the timespan based subcorpora from [Russian National Corpus](https://ruscorpora.ru/new/).

The workshop was conducted by [Andrei Kutuzov](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/andreku/) (University of Oslo) at II Moscow-Tartu School held by the Center of Digital Humanities of the National Research University Higher School of Economics (October 9â€“12, 2017).

There are 3 pages presented the data:

1. [reduced graph of 7 cities](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/)
2. [full graph of top-25 cities](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/graph/)
3. [map of georeferenced places that were caught in models (400+)](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/map/)
