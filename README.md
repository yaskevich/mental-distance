# Mental Distance between Cities
My contribution to workshop on research of places in semantic distributional vector models built on the timespan based subcorpora from [Russian National Corpus](https://ruscorpora.ru/new/).

The workshop was conducted by [Andrei Kutuzov](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/andreku/) (University of Oslo) at II Moscow-Tartu School held by the Center of Digital Humanities of the National Research University Higher School of Economics (October 9â€“12, 2017).

There are 3 pages presenting the data:

1. [reduced graph of 7 cities](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/)
2. [full graph of top-25 cities](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/graph/)
3. [map of georeferenced places that were caught in models (400+ places)](https://yaskevich.github.io/mental-distance/map/)

As well the datasets that were retrieved from the models are available in `data` directory of this repository.
